# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

In this project, text is encoded into RGB image. Logic is pretty simple - Text is converted to binary format and replaced the last 2 bits of each pixel value in RGB image. 

# Requirements
